# microlaunch
A FINAL FANTASY XIV Online native launcher for Linux.

## Why?
XIVLauncher doesn't work for my incredibly fringe use-case.

## Who is this for?
[Myself](https://kagamine-r.in).

## How do you use it?
1. Be familiar with its source code.
2. Use it.  
Sorry, but this tool is not meant for anyone else other than me.
This may change in the future but it's focused around my needs.
Source is out in the open if you want to hack on it, though.
